            <p>The Service provides AI-generated analysis of poker hands for <strong>educational purposes only</strong>. We do not facilitate real-money gambling. Past analysis does not guarantee future results.</p>

            <hr>
            <h3>4. Fair Use & Account Suspension</h3>
            <p>We strive to offer fast, high-quality analysis for normal personal use. <strong>Excessive or automated usage that exceeds normal fair-use limits (e.g., unusually high volume of hand submissions) may result in temporary throttling, suspension, or permanent account termination without prior notice.</strong> We reserve sole discretion in determining what constitutes overuse.</p>

            <hr>
            <h3>5. User Responsibility for Results</h3>
            <p>All strategic decisions you make at the poker table—or elsewhere—are <strong>entirely your responsibility</strong>.

You assume all risk for actions taken based on our recommendations.</p>

            <hr>
            <h3>6. Responsible Gaming</h3>
            <p>Our Service is a study tool, not a gambling facilitator. Play responsibly and within your means. If you believe you may have a gambling problem, seek help from a qualified organization.</p>

            <hr>
            <h3>7. Links to Third-Party Sites</h3>

            <h3>12. Severability & Waiver</h3>
            <p>If any provision is invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of the Terms will remain valid. A failure to enforce any right is not a waiver of future enforcement.</p>

            <h3>13. Changes to Terms</h3>
            <p>We may update these Terms at any time. Material changes will be announced in-app or via email at least 30 days before they take effect. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.</p>
